Hello everyone! 
This is a set of experimental group videos on large field of view nailfold capillary video registration, posted on my Github. 
Our approach is based on traditional projection analysis, with two key improvements for the characteristics of nailfold capillary videos: one is the use of the color space YCrCb conversion, and the other is the optimization of the computation in projection analysis.
The seven sets of experiments cover videos with different jitter conditions and different types of blood vessels, and the effectiveness of the improved method is demonstrated visually by comparing the results before and after the registration.
We welcome your reference and discussion.
